Description: Implements analytical and visualization methods for Plant Trait Multilayer Networks, a framework integrating multilayer network theory with plant trait analysis to quantify coordinated adaptations across organs and functional systems. Provides functions for constructing PTMNs, analyzing cross-layer trait relationships, computing network metrics, and visualizing multidimensional plant adaptation patterns. Methods are based on He et al. (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.tree.2020.06.003>.
