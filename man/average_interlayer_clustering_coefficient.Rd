\title{Average Interlayer Clustering Coefficient for Plant Trait Multilayer Networks}
\usage{
average_interlayer_clustering_coefficient(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A PTMN object created by the \code{PTMN()} function, containing the
multilayer network structure with nodes representing plant traits and edges
representing trait relationships within and across functional layers.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the average interlayer clustering coefficient.
Values range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate stronger cross-layer
integration and more tightly connected functional modules.
}
\description{
Computes the Average Interlayer Clustering Coefficient (AICC) for a plant trait
multilayer network (PTMN). The AICC is the mean interlayer clustering coefficient
across all nodes in the network, capturing the overall prevalence of tightly knit
cross-layer modules. High AICC values indicate that integrated, modular
cross-layer structures are prevalent, reflecting strong phenotypic integration and
modularity, which can allow flexible responses to multidimensional environmental
pressures.
}
\details{
Calculate Average Interlayer Clustering Coefficient

The Average Interlayer Clustering Coefficient is calculated as:

AICC = (1/n) * Σ(ICCᵢ)

where n is the total number of nodes and ICCᵢ denotes the interlayer clustering
coefficient of node vᵢ. This parameter is particularly useful for
understanding multidimensional plant adaptations and coordinated responses across
different plant organs and functional systems.

In the context of plant ecology, higher AICC values suggest that plants have
evolved integrated trait networks that facilitate coordinated responses to
environmental challenges. For example, non-native woody species have been shown
to exhibit higher AICC values compared to native species, potentially contributing
to their invasion success.
