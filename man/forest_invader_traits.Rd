\description{
A comprehensive functional trait dataset comparing native and invasive woody species
in North American deciduous forests. This dataset includes 76 species (44 native,
32 non-native) with 68 continuous functional traits across leaf, stem, root, and
whole-plant characteristics. The data has been processed using probabilistic PCA
(PPCA) for missing value imputation and includes log-transformed variables for
right-skewed distributions.
}
\details{
This dataset represents measurements from a common garden experiment conducted at
Syracuse University from 2006-2018. All continuous traits have been standardized
to zero mean and unit variance, with 37 right-skewed traits log-transformed prior
to standardization. Missing values (29\% of the original dataset) were imputed using
probabilistic PCA with 2 principal components.

The study identified a unique "fast but steady" trait syndrome in invasive species,
combining high metabolic rates with extended leaf duration and robust leaf construction.
Two traits - annual leaf duration and nuclear DNA content - distinguished native
from invasive species with 93\% accuracy.
