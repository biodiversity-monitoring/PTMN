\description{
A phylogenetic tree object containing 76 woody plant species (44 native and 32 non-native)
used in the analysis of functional trait syndromes for forest invaders in North American
deciduous forests. The tree is based on species-level phylogeny with aged branch lengths
and includes native, naturalized, and invasive species classifications.
}
\details{
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using correlation matrix of phylogenetic distances
calculated with an aged tree based on the species-level phylogeny. The tree includes
representatives from major angiosperm families and is used for phylogenetically
independent contrasts in trait analysis. Branch lengths reflect evolutionary time,
and the tree structure allows for proper phylogenetic corrections in comparative
analyses of functional traits between native and invasive species.

Species include shrubs and vines from deciduous forests, with invasive species
representing those managed as high-impact invaders in northeastern United States,
and naturalized species representing non-native species that have established
but are not considered highly invasive.
