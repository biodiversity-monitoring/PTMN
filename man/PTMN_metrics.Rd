\title{Calculate Plant Trait Multilayer Network (PTMN) Metrics}
\usage{
PTMN_metrics(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A multilayer network object created by the \code{\link{PTMN}} function,
representing trait relationships across different plant organs or functional systems.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames:
\describe{
\item{node}{Node-level metrics including:
\itemize{
\item \code{node}: Name of the trait node
\item \code{layer}: Layer (organ/functional system) containing the node
\item \code{interlayer_degree}: Number of connections a node has across layers
\item \code{interlayer_closeness}: Measure of how close a node is to all other nodes across layers
\item \code{interlayer_clustering_coefficient}: Local clustering coefficient considering interlayer connections
}
}
\item{global}{Global network metrics including:
\itemize{
\item \code{Interlayer_edge_density}: Proportion of possible interlayer connections that are realized
\item \code{Average_interlayer_path_length}: Average shortest path length between nodes across layers
\item \code{Average_interlayer_clustering_coefficient}: Network-wide clustering coefficient
\item \code{Module_interlayer_association}: Degree of modular organization across layers
}
}
}
}
\description{
This function computes comprehensive network metrics for plant trait multilayer networks,
including both node-level and global network properties. It quantifies the structural
characteristics and connectivity patterns that reveal coordinated adaptation mechanisms
across multiple plant organs and functional systems.
}
\details{
The PTMN framework addresses limitations of traditional single-layer plant trait networks
by capturing trait relationships across multiple plant organs and functional systems.
These metrics quantify network topology using specially designed parameters that facilitate
identification of hub traits and key cross-layer functional modules, essential for
understanding coordinated adaptation of plant traits.

Node-level metrics help identify traits that serve as integration points across different
plant systems, while global metrics characterize the overall network structure and
connectivity patterns. Higher interlayer connectivity may indicate greater functional
integration and potentially enhanced adaptive capacity.
